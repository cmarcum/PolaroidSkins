# PolaroidSkins
A repository to collaborate on sx70/slr680/slr690 polaroid camera foldout skins. This repository was established after visiting the Brooklyn Film Camera 2021 NYC Film Meet. I was inpsired by the generoisity and kindness of the film community and wanted to give something back. 

#SX-70 Initial commit 
This initial prototype is based on dimensions acquired from https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4879934. The corner accuracy could be improved.

#Color Stripe Scheme
The original 7 color stripe scheme used in Poloroid branding by [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Giambarba
 Paul Giambarba] was designed for the colorpack II and introduced in 1968. Paul has a great summary of the evolution of the scheme on his old blog here:
 [https://giam.typepad.com/the_branding_of_polaroid_/2004/07/polaroids_famou.html The Branding of Polaroid]. For convenience, I've included an approximate HEX code list below for the original seven colors.
